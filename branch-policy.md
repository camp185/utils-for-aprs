# Branch Policy

utils-for-aprs uses a 'gitflow' branching policy as described in
[A Successful Git Branching Model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

New features should be developed on a feature branch.  When appropriate, they get
merged into the 'develop' branch.  Release branches track the releases, and the
'master' branch always contains the latest release.
